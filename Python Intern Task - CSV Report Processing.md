# Python Intern Task - CSV Report Processing
An important part of the operations of an AdTech platform is making sure metrics reported
by different systems don‚Äôt have significant discrepancies. These systems usually have
peculiar report interfaces, so we need some automation to obtain data that we can compare.

We have an ad campaign where ads are displayed in multiple countries. A single ad view is
called an impression and users click on ads. Ads are designed and targeted to maximize
click to impression rate ( CTR ). CTR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the
number of impressions and is usually written as a percentage.

A third-party ad server company offers CSV reports with daily impression numbers and
CTRs for our campaign, aggregated per state (or any other ISO 3166-2 subdivision). Our
system has reports aggregated by country.

Your task is to write a Python script that reads a CSV file of such third-party data. Based on
standard input, the script should output a CSV file with a report aggregated by date and
country.

## Input format:
UTF-8 or UTF-16 CSV file (with any kind of line endings), with columns: date
(MM/DD/YYYY), state name, number of impressions and CTR percentage.
### Output format:
UTF-8 CSV file with Unix line endings, with columns: date (YYYY-MM-DD),
three letter country code (or XXX for unknown states), number of impressions, number of
clicks (rounded, assuming the CTR is exact). Rows are sorted lexicographically by date
followed by the country code.

If the input file has errors, appropriate error messages should be written to the standard error
(stderr). An output CSV should be produced if the errors are not critical (if it‚Äôs not clear which
ones are critical, the solution should include an explanation of your reasoning).

##Tips:
‚óè UTF-16 has a byte order mark, otherwise it would be ambiguous. Just like UTF-8, it
has a variable width, but this detail shouldn‚Äôt be noticeable in the solution.
‚óè While a single date represents different times in different regions, here they are all
UTC.
‚óè Region names and codes used are provided by https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/
‚óè We use Python 3.7; you can use external libraries available on PyPI (like pycountry)
if you submit a requirements.txt listing them with versions (these are output by pip
freeze ). If a different Python version is needed, please provide a Dockerfile setting
up a proper environment for running the script.
‚óè CSV isn‚Äôt standard and has many dialects, but here we can assume that all fields
have no quoting, no commas and are separated literally by commas.
What we‚Äôd like to see:
‚óè Readable code (consider comments and docstrings that would help understand and
maintain it)
‚óè Error handling

## Example input:
```
01/21/2019,Mandiana,883,0.38%
01/21/2019,Lola,76,0.78%
01/21/2019,FƒÅryƒÅb,919,0.67%
01/22/2019,Lola,201,0.82%
01/22/2019,Beroun,139,0.61%
01/22/2019,Mandiana,1050,0.93%
01/23/2019,üê±,777,0.22%
01/23/2019,Gaoual,72,0.7%
01/23/2019,Lola,521,0.19%
01/24/2019,Beroun,620,0.1%
01/24/2019,Unknown,586,0.86%
01/24/2019,üê±,1082,0.68%
```

## Example output:
```
2019-01-21,AFG,919,6
2019-01-21,GIN,959,4
2019-01-22,CZE,139,1
2019-01-22,GIN,1251,12
2019-01-23,GIN,593,2
2019-01-23,XXX,777,2
2019-01-24,CZE,620,1
2019-01-24,XXX,1668,12
```
## Good luck!
